# ASV twin-thruster control

The controller accepts independent port and starboard thrust requests in
newtons. It clamps unsafe values and sets a thruster to zero if its command is
not refreshed within 0.75 seconds.

## Gazebo acceptance test

Build the workspace once:

```bash
cd ~/ros_projects/asv
source /opt/ros/lyrical/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

Start Gazebo in terminal 1:

```bash
cd ~/ros_projects/asv
./tools/run_sim.bash
```

After the ASV appears, run the automatic maneuver in terminal 2:

```bash
cd ~/ros_projects/asv
./tools/test_thrusters.bash
```

The sequence commands forward motion, a stop, an in-place turn, reverse
motion, and a final stop.

## Keyboard control

With Gazebo running, start keyboard control in another terminal:

```bash
cd ~/ros_projects/asv
source /opt/ros/lyrical/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run asv_control keyboard_teleop
```

Use `W`/up for forward, `S`/down for reverse, `A`/left and `D`/right for
pivot turns, and Space or `X` to stop. Press `Q` to stop and exit. The selected
command remains active until another key is pressed, so always stop before
leaving the terminal.

## ROS interface

Command topics (`std_msgs/msg/Float64`, newtons):

- `/asv/thrusters/port/command`
- `/asv/thrusters/starboard/command`

Applied-command feedback topics (`std_msgs/msg/Float64`, newtons):

- `/asv/thrusters/port/applied`
- `/asv/thrusters/starboard/applied`

Emergency stop service:

```bash
ros2 service call /asv/thrusters/stop std_srvs/srv/Trigger '{}'
```

For a persistent manual command, publish both sides from separate terminals.
For example, 8 N on both sides drives straight:

```bash
ros2 topic pub -r 10 /asv/thrusters/port/command \
  std_msgs/msg/Float64 '{data: 8.0}'
```

```bash
ros2 topic pub -r 10 /asv/thrusters/starboard/command \
  std_msgs/msg/Float64 '{data: 8.0}'
```

Positive thrust is forward. Opposite signs produce a pivot turn. Commands
must be published continuously because the watchdog intentionally rejects
stale commands.
